description         constant::defer - constant subs with deferred value calculation

long_description    constant::defer creates a subroutine which on the first \
                    call runs given code to calculate its value, and on any \
                    subsequent calls just returns that value, like a \
                    constant. The value code is discarded once run, \
                    allowing it to be garbage collected.
