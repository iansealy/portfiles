description         Test::Needs - Skip tests when modules not available

long_description    Skip test scripts if modules are not available. The \
                    requested modules will be loaded, and optionally have \
                    their versions checked. If the module is missing, the \
                    test script will be skipped. Modules that are found but \
                    fail to compile will exit with an error rather than skip.
