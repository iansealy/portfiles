description         Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON - Validate a META.json file within a CPAN distribution

long_description    This module was written to ensure that a META.json \
                    file, provided with a standard distribution uploaded to \
                    CPAN, meets the specifications that are slowly being \
                    introduced to module uploads, via the use of package \
                    makers and installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, \
                    Module::Build and Module::Install.
